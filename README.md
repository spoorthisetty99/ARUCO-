# ARUCO-
Aruco markers are a type of 2D barcode or fiducial marker used in computer vision Application.hey were introduced by the OpenCV library, which is a popular computer vision library developed by OpenCV.org.

Aruco markers are designed to be easily detectable and identifiable in images or video frames, even when captured in different lighting conditions or from various angles. These markers consist of a pattern of black and white squares arranged in a specific way to create a unique identification code. The code can be interpreted by computer vision algorithms to determine the marker's position, orientation, and identity in the camera's field of view.

Each Aruco marker contains an encoded ID, which is a numerical value used to uniquely identify the marker. A dictionary is used to associate IDs with their corresponding marker patterns. Different Aruco marker libraries and applications may use different dictionaries.
